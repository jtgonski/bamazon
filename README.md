## Bamazon Customer *bamazonCustomer.js*

This CLI connects to bamazon_db and allows customers to view products, product ids, and product prices. Customers can then select a product and the quatity they want to purchase. If the user has selected more items than are in stock, the program will prevent the transaction from occuring and give the user and error. However, if there are enough items in stock, they will be given an total price and the quantity of the product will be deducted from the database.
